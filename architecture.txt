- An event must exist in the event store before it is made available for processing

- processing an event by an activity will yield an action
-- the processing method of activity should be a pure function because the activity will be re-executed 
   if the systems fails while waiting for an activity to return its action
-- or, an activity can modify the world on  through the action returned by its processing method  
  
- error handling code should be injected (using some sort of AOP ... guice !?) 
  
- any object can be persisted to gae's store. most probably a refactoring api will be required

- mmm activities could declare their interest in a specific kind of event (all events have a kind)
